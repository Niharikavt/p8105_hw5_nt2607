## Problem 1

Importing the data in individual spreadsheets contained in
`./data/zip_data/`. To do this, I create a dataframe that includes the
list of all files in that directory and the complete path to each file.
As a next step, I `map` over paths and import data using the `read_csv`
function. Finally, I `unnest` the result of `map`.

``` r
full_df = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files("data/zip_data/"),
    path = str_c("data/zip_data/", files)
  )
```
